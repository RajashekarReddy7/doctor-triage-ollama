If you could start by telling me what brings you here or any health concerns you've been experiencing, that would be great. It's important to me that we understand your symptoms and the impact they have on your daily life.\n\nIf you'd like, let's start with some basic questions: Can you describe the symptoms you are experiencing? How long have you been feeling this way, and has anything changed recently in your health status or lifestyle? Have you noticed any patterns or triggers associated with these symptoms? Are there any specific activities that worsen them or provide relief?\n\nI want to make sure I gather as much information as possible to help understand what might be going on. If anything is unclear or you'd like to add more details, please feel free!"
