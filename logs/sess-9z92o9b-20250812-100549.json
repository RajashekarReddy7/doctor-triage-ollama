Could you please describe what symptoms or concerns you've been experiencing lately so we can better understand the situation together? Also, when did these symptoms start, and have they worsened or improved over time? This helps me assess their severity and any potential red flags. If you prefer, I can also ask specific questions about your symptoms one by one if that feels more comfortable for you."
