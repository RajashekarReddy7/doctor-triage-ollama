A constant headache for one day can have various causes, but if it's severe or accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, it could be a sign of something more serious. It would be best to get in touch with your primary care provider as soon as possible for an evaluation. In the meantime, try to rest and stay hydrated."
